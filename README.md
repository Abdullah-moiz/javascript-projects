## About 'javascript-projects' repository

Right now, this repository contains 13 beginner-friendly projects. All of these projects are developed without the use of any external framework. I've tried using the latest ES6 Javascript features while developing these projects.

## What's unique about this repository?

Well, every project which you see above is hosted online and can be visualised easily just by cilicking its respective link. Moreover, each folder conatins their own description file which states the things/technologies/tech-stack which I got to learn by developing them. 

## How to access hosted projects?

To enhnace the accessibilty, I've packed all the links in a single file.
Follow this link [https://ishubham21.github.io/javascript-projects/](https://ishubham21.github.io/javascript-projects/) to make a move. 


## Difficulty

The difficulty of the projects is between 'easy' to 'intermediate'.

## What's coming next?

I'll be adding more projects equiped with AJAX and projects which make use of APIs to facilitate development and data transfer.
