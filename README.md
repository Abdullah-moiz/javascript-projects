## About 'javascript-projects' repository

Right now, this repository contains 16 beginner-friendly projects. All of these projects are developed without the use of any external framework. I've tried using the latest ES6 Javascript features while developing these projects.
Though the design-tech used for developing these projects makes it ready to be viewed in mobile phones, but it's highly suggested to use desktop computer for viewing purposes.
## What's unique about this repository?

Well, every project which you see above is hosted online and can be visualised easily just by clicking its respective link. Moreover, each folder contains their own description file which states the things/technologies/tech-stack which I got to learn by developing them. 

## How to access hosted projects?

To enhance the accessibility, I've packed all the links in a single file.

## Difficulty

The difficulty of the projects is between 'easy' to 'intermediate'.

## What's in store for you?

Matters. Right? 

So, if you're a budding developer who's looking for projects to work upon, this can be a great help to you. You can just play around with the projects, understand their working and try making/re-developing them via your own approaches and algorithms. (Bonus - If you ever feel stuck, you can always look up the code and help yourself).

If you already have had some experience with the language and have some projects to contribute, you're most welcome. You can always submit a Pull Request (PR) and get them merged. 

(P.S. If you happen to submit a project, all you need to do is make a folder of your project, number it correctly and add a link to your project in the index.html file. Cheers!)

## What's coming next?

I'll be adding more projects equipped with AJAX and projects which make use of APIs to facilitate development and data transfer.
